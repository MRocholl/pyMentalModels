1. The conjunction of a pair of models containing respectively a proposition and its negation yields the
null model (of an impossible instance), e.g.:
A B and : A
B yield nil
2. The conjunction of a pair of models that are not contradictory yields a model representing all the
properties in the models, e.g.:
A B and B C yield A B C
3. The conjunction of a null model with any model yields the null model, e.g.:
A B and nil
yield nil
4. If one mental model represents a proposition, A, which is not represented in the second mental
model, and A occurs in at least one of the set of models from which the second model is drawn, then
its absence in the second model is treated as its negation (and procedure 2 above applies); otherwise
its absence is treated as its affirmation (and procedure 3 above applies). This procedure applies only
to mental models
